### **1\. Overview: The "Why"**

#### **1.1. Problem Statement**

Finding and booking local recreational activities like pools, billiard tables, or escape rooms is a fragmented and inefficient process. Users lack a single, reliable platform for discovery and booking, while activity providers struggle to manage availability and reach a wider audience effectively.

#### **1.2. Proposed Solution**

OutGo is a mobile application that acts as a centralized marketplace, connecting users with local activity providers. It allows users to discover, compare, and book activities in real-time. For providers, OutGo is a simple tool to list services, manage schedules, and increase customer traffic.

#### **1.3. Strategic Alignment / Business Case**

OutGo aims to capture a significant share of the local entertainment and leisure market. The primary business model is commission-based, taking a percentage fee from providers for each booking made through the app. This aligns our revenue with our providers' success and establishes a scalable foundation for future growth.
